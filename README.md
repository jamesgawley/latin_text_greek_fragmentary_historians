# latin_text_greek_fragmentary_historians
Latin translations of the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum by MÃ¼ller. From XML files: https://github.com/dfhg-project.

This repository contains Latin translations of Greek fragmentary texts. All text was originally digitized by Monica Berti, and the original XML and EpicDoc XML files can be found at https://github.com/dfhg-project. The present repository represents a conversion to .tess format, essentially unicode-8 plaintext with locus tags at the beginning of each line.

These texts have parallels in Greek, which can be found at http://github.com/jamesgawley/greek_text_greek_fragmentary_historians.
